Text answer to Question 5 is in the file 'Task4Rana.doc' 

---------------------------
The file titled 'Task4Rana.rkt' is the Racket code file for HW4 Questions 1-4.
The purpose of this assignment is to epxerince programming in a functional programming language,
and create functions in the functional prorgamming language, Racket.

The file 'Task4Rana.rkt' contains 4 defined functions.

The function 'delall' takes in two parameters, an atom and a list, that returns a list
identical to the given parameter list but removes any instance of the given atom from the list.

The function 'getextremes' takes in a list as a parameter, and returns the maximum and minimum
number in the list.

The function 'unite' takes in two lists as parameters and returns the union of the two lists.

The function 'checkset' takes in a list as a parameter and returns true (#t) if the list
does not contain any duplicate elements else returns false (#f).
==========================
Running the file:
1) You can open the file in DrRacket. Open DrRacket.

2) Click on File menu at the top left of the DrRacket application and then click Open... to open 
   the Racket file from your file directory.

3) Input the function name you wish to run along with filling the appropriate parameters for the 
functions into the Racket execution/command line.

4) Run the file.
