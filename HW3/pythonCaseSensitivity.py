#Description: To demonstrate case sensitivity of identifiers in Python.


#PART 1:******************************
#Creates variable 'inch' and 'INCH', and assigns two different values to each
inch = 12
INCH = 4

#Printing 'inch' outputs 12, and 'INCH' outputs 4 gives, two different outputs.
print("inch:", inch)
print("INCH:", INCH, "\n")
#This shows that variables 'inch' and 'INCH' are two different cases, and that
#variables in Python are case-sensitve.


#PART 2::******************************

#Creates variable 'int' and assigns a value of 5. 
int = 5
print("print:",int, "\n")
#In Python int, double, and float, are keywords but not reserver words,
#meaning they can be used as identifiers, as shown above. 



#PART 3::******************************
#Creates variable 'height' and assigns a float value to it without declaring 
#the variable type.
height = 53.2
#Prints 'height'
print("height:", height)
#This shows that in Python you do not need to declare the variable type before
#assigning a value to it.
